# JavaScript Game Development Studies with HTML Canvas

Welcome to my collection of my ongoing studies focused on JavaScript game development using the HTML canvas. 

This repository documents my journey through learning various aspects of game development, 
from basic sprite animation to implementing a scrolling background, managing enemies, and handling collision detection and so on....

## Overview

This repository is structured to progressively introduce more complex game development concepts. 
Each section is dedicated to a specific aspect of game development, starting with simple sprite animations and advancing through to more complex game mechanics.

## Getting Started
